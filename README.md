# cumware osint
website: http://0day.cfd

cumware is an open source intelligence framework that allows users to remotely scrape database breaches using the leaked wiki, construct obfuscated exploits,
and accurately provide a good forefront on gathering data.

## real cumware.
most of this is old code i wrote back in 2021 to try and make my own "osint" framework when i reality i only wrote 3-4 files and 'heavily modified' the rest of it from breachnet.sh


# disclaimer
by using cumware's framework you acknowledge that the developer is not responsible for your actions or any criminal activity you commit.

just finished revamping most of my old code on /app, /command, /logger and /modules.
