pwnmap is an open source intelligence framework that allows users to remotely scrape database breaches using the leaked wiki, construct obfuscated exploits, spam, attack 
and accurately provide a good forefront on gathering data.
pwnmap works by using the WeLeakInfo and Leakcheck API to accurate retrieve leak information and use a scraping engine on python to properly gather results and information on a target quickly, efficiently and stealthily.

## real pwnmap.
most of this is old code i wrote back in 2021 to try and make my own "osint" framework when i reality i only wrote 3-4 files and 'heavily modified' the rest of it from breachnet.sh


# disclaimer
by using pwnmap's framework you acknowledge that the developer is not responsible for your actions or any criminal activity you commit.

just finished revamping most of my old code on /app, /command, /logger and /modules.
